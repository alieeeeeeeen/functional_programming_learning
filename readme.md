# Prerequisites

## Programming paradigm

Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming language based on their features. Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms.

- imperative
    - procedural - which merely includes instructions
    - object-oriented - which inculdes instructions and state

- declarative
    - functional - *the desired result* is declared as the value of a *series* of function applications
    - logic - *the desired result* is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts or rules
    - mathematical - *the desired result* is declared as the solution of an optimization problem

- symbolic: To build intricate processes by combining smaller units of logic or functionality. Thus, such programs can effetively modify themselves and appear to "learn".

## Immutable object

An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. Immutable objects are useful because they are inherently ***thread-safe***

# Functional Programming

Functional programming is designed to handle symbolic computation. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions.

- Pure functional programming
- Impure functional programming

## Functional Programming Advantages

- Bug-Free Code - Functional programming does not support state, so there are no side-effect

- Efficient Parallel Programming - Functional Programming has immutable state, so there are no state-change issues. One can programe "Functions" to work parallelly as "instructions". Such code supports reusability and testability.

## Functional Programming Characteristics

- Functional Programming supports **high-order functons** and **lazy evaluation** features
- States are Immutable
